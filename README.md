## Introduction
Can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) understand human emotions in dynamic, multimodal settings? To address this question, we introduce <b>EmoBench-M</b>, a comprehensive benchmark grounded in psychological theories of Emotional Intelligence (EI), designed to evaluate the EI capabilities of MLLMs across video, audio, and text. <b>EmoBench-M</b> spans 13 diverse scenarios across three key dimensions of EI: Foundational Emotion Recognition, Conversational Emotion Understanding, and Socially Complex Emotion Analysis. It includes over 5000 carefully curated samples and both classification and generation tasks, covering a wide range of real-world affective contexts. Through extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs—including open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL and InternVL2.5, and proprietary models such as Gemini 2.0 Flash—we find that (i) current MLLMs significantly lag behind human performance, especially in conversational and socially complex tasks; (ii) model size alone does not guarantee better emotional reasoning; and (iii) nuanced social emotions and intent understanding remain particularly challenging. We hope EmoBench-M provides a solid foundation for future research toward emotionally intelligent AI systems.
