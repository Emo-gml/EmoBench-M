## 🌸 About
This repository contains the official evaluation code and data for the paper "**EmoBench-M: Benchmarking Emotional Intelligence for Multimodal Large Language Models**". See more details in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04424).

> Can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) understand human emotions in dynamic, multimodal settings? To address this question, we introduce <b>EmoBench-M</b>, a comprehensive benchmark grounded in psychological theories of Emotional Intelligence (EI), designed to evaluate the EI capabilities of MLLMs across video, audio, and text. <b>EmoBench-M</b> spans 13 diverse scenarios across three key dimensions of EI: Foundational Emotion Recognition, Conversational Emotion Understanding, and Socially Complex Emotion Analysis. It includes over 5000 carefully curated samples and both classification and generation tasks, covering a wide range of real-world affective contexts. Through extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs—including open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL and InternVL2.5, and proprietary models such as Gemini 2.0 Flash—we find that (i) current MLLMs significantly lag behind human performance, especially in conversational and socially complex tasks; (ii) model size alone does not guarantee better emotional reasoning; and (iii) nuanced social emotions and intent understanding remain particularly challenging. We hope EmoBench-M provides a solid foundation for future research toward emotionally intelligent AI systems.

## 🔥 Quick Start
## 📥 Download Data

To use this benchmark, **please first download the original video files and corresponding annotation `.json` files** from the link below:

🔗 **[Download Videos & JSONs](YOUR_LINK_HERE)**  
*(Replace `YOUR_LINK_HERE` with your actual data hosting link)*

Each JSON file contains conversation-style prompts and labels aligned with the corresponding video clips. The structure looks like:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "0",
    "video": "videos/ch-simsv2s/aqgy4_0004/00023.mp4",
    "conversations": [
      {
        "from": "human",
        "value": "<video>\nThe person in video says: ... Determine the emotion conveyed..."
      },
      {
        "from": "gpt",
        "value": "negative"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
