## Introduction
<b>EmoBench-M<b> is the first benchmark to integrate video, audio, and text for multimodal emotion understanding. Grounded in the theory of emotional intelligence, it focuses on three core competencies: basic emotion recognition, conversational emotion understanding, and social complex emotion analysis. It features 13 real-world evaluation scenarios, including music emotion recognition, stock review emotion analysis, multi-party conversation emotion recognition, and humor/sarcasm detection. By simulating the complex and dynamic emotional expressions found in human-human and human-machine interactions, it fills the gap left by existing single-modality or static emotion recognition datasets.
